The detective has a few open cases.

Every day it's getting harder to get out of bed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEFT UNDETECTED is a tiny story about not wanting to do the thing you've done all
your life, and how awful that can feel.

## Controls

Arrow keys or touch to move the phone, any key to advance the dialog text. The
detective is lying on the couch.

## Dev notes

Made with [Bitsy](http://ledoux.io/bitsy/editor.html), the tiny, adorable game construction kit. I made some modifications to support scripting exits to new rooms inside dialogue, fetching game data from a URL, and setting the page title from the game data. 

The Bitsy editor only permits 2-frame animations, but the engine supports multi-frame animations if you hand-edit the game data. I'm using a few 3-frame animations that were pretty easy to add.

## Miscellany

Made for Global Game Jam 2018, theme "Transmission".

All you detectives, drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mildmojo). I'd love to hear what
you think.
